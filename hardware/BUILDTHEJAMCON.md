# Build the JamCon
Hi, this is an extra guide for building the JamCon hardware. 
Actually its not a guide, rather a blog of way of engineering.

# What you will learn:
1. you will receive design recommendations for 3D models and PCBs,

2. Step by step guidance for beginners,

3. what software you need for your hardware,

4. about expansion opportunities and the open source capabilities of this project.

# The beginnings:
I had a rough plan, 3D printing a case for all the fragile components and printing a PCB for button input.
Other hardware i use is a 3D printer, a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and some essential tools like screwdrivers and stuff like that.
First I designed de schematics of my PCB like this:

The PCB should be conected to a Pi Zero 2 W by a little 10 pin connector.

# This Repo is still a Work in progress. ðŸš§
Please keep in mind that some things might not work like they should.
